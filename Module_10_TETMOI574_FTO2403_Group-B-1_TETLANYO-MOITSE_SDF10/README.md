## [SDF10] API Learning Reflection ðŸ§ 

Welcome to the [SDF10] API Learning Reflection! Through this exercise, you will reflect on key concepts, practical experiences, and the tools you've encountered or used in API interactions.

1. **Understanding and Application**: Reflecting on the key concepts, can you explain in your own words what an API is and its significance in software development? Provide an example of how you have used or encountered an API in a project or a practical scenario.

[An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and mechanisms for building software and applications and provides ways for various to interact with each other.
A practical scenario of an API is that of a restuarant experience.bThe waiter at the resuarant taking your order and delivering your request to the kitchen embodies the API, that serves as a middleman that enables two software applications to communicate with each other in the digital landscape.]

2. **Conceptual Distinctions**: How would you differentiate between an interface and an API? 

[An Interface has a shared boundary across two separate components of a computer hardware, devices, humans and combinations of these and encompasses all interaction points between two systems, device or users, which can be tangible or conceptual, whereas with an API, it is a type of interface between two software entities through rules and protocols.]

3. **Components and Types of APIs**: Can you identify the main components of an API and describe their roles? Reflect on the different types of APIs mentioned (e.g., Web APIs, RESTful APIs) and discuss which type you find most intriguing or useful, and why.

[The main components of an API is Endpoints (which refers to a specific path where API-related functions can be accessed),HTTP Methods (such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) that define the action to be performed on the data at the endpoint, and Data formats is the data that is exchanged between clients and servers via APIs which is structured in specific formats to ensure both sides can read and understand data.
There are different types of APIs, such as the Web API, which operates over the internet and facilitates interactions between systems or devices and web servers hosting them.
The type of API that I find intriguing is Harware APIs because they allow software to interact, control and retrieve data from hardware devices, controlling internal components to the external peripherals like printers, cameras, etc. .

4. **Practical Application and Tools**: Reflect on your experience with API exploration and implementation. Have you used any specific tools (such as Curl or API exploration tools) or libraries to interact with APIs? 

[Yes I have.]

5. **Learning and Improvement**: Considering the key concepts and your practical experiences, identify one area related to APIs where you feel confident and one area where you see a need for improvement. What steps will you take to enhance your understanding and skills in the area you wish to improve?

[I understand the basics of HTTP, including methods such as (PUT, DELETE), status codes and request/response structure and also reading API documentation and making simple API requests. I want to improve by exploring API libraries to deepen my understanding of this and also build projects that intergrate with one or more APIs.]
